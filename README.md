# SQL - Bike-Sales-Analysis
The project uses data from the USA Bikesales from 2016 to 2018. Dataset consists of the production and sales schemas. All goods, categories, and brands are listed in the production schemas. Sales schemas provide data on overall sales as well as customer demographics. A bespoke dataset comprised of the total income generated and other pertinent fields must be created per the client's requirement. Finally, using data visualisation tools, the trends must be displayed in the form of dashboards.
## Tools used:
1. Microsoft SQL server management Studio 2021
